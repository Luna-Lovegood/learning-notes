Learn LaTeX with [_The Not So Short Introduction to LATEX 2ε_](http://mirrors.opencas.org/ctan/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf)  
中文版：[《一份不太简短的 LATEX 2ε 介绍》](http://mirrors.opencas.org/ctan/info/lshort/chinese/lshort-zh-cn.pdf)

> **LATEX** is a typesetting system that is very suitable for producing scientific
and mathematical documents of high typographical quality. It is also suitable
for producing all sorts of other documents, from simple letters to complete
books. LATEX uses TEX as its formatting engine.
This short introduction describes LATEX 2ε and should be sufficient for
most applications of LATEX.

> This introduction is split into 6 chapters:  
**Chapter 1** tells you about the basic structure of LATEX 2ε documents. You
will also learn a bit about the history of LATEX. After reading this
chapter, you should have a rough understanding how LATEX works.  
**Chapter 2** goes into the details of typesetting your documents. It explains
most of the essential LATEX commands and environments. After reading
this chapter, you will be able to write your first documents.  
**Chapter 3** explains how to typeset formulae with LATEX. Many examples
demonstrate how to use one of LATEX’s main strengths. At the end
of the chapter are tables listing all mathematical symbols available in
LATEX.  
**Chapter 4** explains indexes, bibliography generation and inclusion of EPS
graphics. It introduces creation of PDF documents with pdfLATEX and
presents some handy extension packages.  
**Chapter 5** shows how to use LATEX for creating graphics. Instead of drawing
a picture with some graphics program, saving it to a file and then
including it into LATEX, you describe the picture and have LATEX draw
it for you.  
**Chapter 6** contains some potentially dangerous information about how to
alter the standard document layout produced by LATEX. It will tell you
how to change things such that the beautiful output of LATEX turns
ugly or stunning, depending on your abilities.
